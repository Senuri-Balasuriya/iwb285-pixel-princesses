Savory Save – Food Waste Reduction App
Project Overview
Savory Save is a web application designed to help individuals and households reduce food waste through better meal planning, efficient food storage, and creative use of ingredients. Our app encourages users to make the most of the food they already have by offering recipe suggestions, storage tips, and ideas to repurpose leftovers, all tailored to the food items available in their kitchen.

The project is built with modern web development technologies and emphasizes API integration, microservices orchestration, and event-driven architecture to provide a seamless and dynamic user experience.
